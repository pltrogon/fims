FIMS is a DOE-funded partnership between the University of Hawaii at Manoa and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to develop an "ideal" MPGD readout system, with the following technical objectives:

1. Single-charge efficiency over 0.95
2. Ion backflow of less than one per primary charge
3. 3D spatial resolution in the 10 micron range

All project code is tracked in this repo, including simulation, acquisition, and analysis code.
