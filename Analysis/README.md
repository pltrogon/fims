# FIMS: Data Analysis Code
## Table of Contents:
1. electronAvalanche - Jupyterlabs (Python) analysis of Garfield++ simulations of electron avalanches.
2. FIMS_Geometry - Jupyterlabs (Python) analysis of finite element construction of FIMS geometry.
3. FIMS_SIM - Jupyterlabs (Python) analysis of Garfield++ simulations of electron avalanches generated with the FIMS geometry.

## REQUIRED:
* Filepaths assume a symbolic link to the folder where data has been generated.
    * To create a symbolic link for FIMS_SIM, execute the following commands in terminal:
      1. cd <PATHTODOWNLOAD>/fims/DataAnalysis/FIMS_SIM/
      2. ln -s ../../DataGeneration/FIMS_SIM/Data Data
